Welcome to the FlyDA62 blog! We're excited to share insights, operating tips, and real-world experiences flying the Diamond DA-62 in the NYC metro area.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover topics that matter to multi-engine pilots, aircraft owners, and anyone considering the DA-62 for business or personal aviation:

- **Operating Cost Comparisons** — Real numbers from our DA-62 vs. traditional twins like the Baron G58, Seneca, and Cessna 310
- **Mission Profiles** — How pilots use the DA-62 for business travel, family trips, and training
- **Technology Deep Dives** — G1000 NXi tips, autopilot features, and diesel engine operations
- **NYC Metro Flying** — Best destinations within 500 nm of KFRG, weather patterns, and local tips

## Why the DA-62?

We believe the Diamond DA-62 represents the future of light twin aviation. Here's why:

1. **Fuel Efficiency** — Austro AE300 diesel engines burn ~12 gal/hr combined (Jet-A), roughly half what you'd see in a comparable piston twin
2. **Modern Avionics** — G1000 NXi with GFC600 autopilot and envelope protection
3. **Proven Safety** — Composite airframe, FIKI certification, and excellent single-engine performance
4. **Spacious Cabin** — Seven seats with room for passengers and baggage

## Coming Soon

We're working on several in-depth articles:

- Baron G58 vs DA-62: A Complete Operating Cost Breakdown
- Best Weekend Destinations from KFRG (Republic Airport)
- Understanding Diesel Engine Operations: What Every DA-62 Pilot Should Know
- IFR in the Northeast: Real-World FIKI Performance
